#### Body Fay Dataset Prediction
#### This project is about body fat dataset prediction with a simple and robust model. We did a linear regression model with a 2 page summary and a shiny app to present. There is a Body Fat calculator included in the shiny app.

## The Shiny App is in the code folder, and it's the one called app.R

## Data cleaning, running of analysis, modeling are all included in bodyfat_code.Rmd which is also in code file. Also, this Rmarkdown is also the code for summary.

## All images and tables we used are all in the plots folders.

## You can open the summary through summary.pdf, and you can run the summary code in bodyfat_code.Rmd which is in code file.

## You can find our powerpoint for presentation through presentation.pptx.
